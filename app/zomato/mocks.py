The star of the meal, though was the \"weekly\" fromaggio which was burrata with spring vegetables. Impeccable flavours (and enough to act as a meal if you so desire- in fact, I thought it would have been great served on crust as a pizza). Enjoyable dining experience overall.",

For example, I had high hopes for the tellagio and mushroom pie but the tellagio overpowered the pizza completely and was too rich to enjoy! However, the simpler menu items are great. I love the frito misto mushroom appetizer! Very good. And the caponatina was amazing. The pastas are also great - the goat cheese agnolotti was my most recent, satisfying choice. The wine selection is vast and it is easy to get overwhelmed. We fixed that issue by studying the wine list beforehand and narrowing it down to a few options. That being said, while the food is consistently good, the service is spotty. Last time we went in a group of 6 and were ignored for most of the meal. It was a birthday event for a family member but the waiter was not attentive at all and seemed more preoccupied with the other tables around us. That is why I am giving them a lower rating. However, we will most likely be back again because the food is good and the location is convenient for all of us.",
